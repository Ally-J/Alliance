Hiya! My name is **Allyson!**
- I am a hobbyist who likes making random stuff using what I know.
- I quite frequently lose interest in projects I work on. (trying to work on that work ethic)
- I yap alot on discord, you can probably find me at [Halls of Excursia](https://discord.gg/YrbpYFGAGe)
- okay that's probably enough typing now scram.
